## 🔵 Space Stone - Fast Text Search
**What it does:** Uses distributed indexes and sharding for lightning-fast keyword matching

**Search Algorithm:**
- **Inverted Index Search**: Creates a fast lookup table where each word points to all products containing it
- **Distributed Sharding**: Splits the 21,176+ product database across multiple virtual shards for parallel processing
- **Exact Text Matching**: Perfect for finding products when you know specific keywords

**Best for:**
- Searching for specific product names: "iPhone", "Samsung Galaxy"
- Brand searches: "Sony", "Apple", "JBL"
- Exact model numbers: "SRS-XB23", "TUNE 750BTNC"

**Example:** Search "bluetooth" → Space Stone finds ALL products with "bluetooth" in any field instantly

## 🟡 Mind Stone - Smart AI Search  
**What it does:** Analyzes intent, handles synonyms, spell correction, and query expansion

**Search Algorithm:**
- **Synonym Matching**: "phone" matches "mobile", "cellphone", "smartphone"
- **Spell Correction**: "blutooth" → "bluetooth", "lptop" → "laptop"  
- **Query Expansion**: "headphone" also searches for "earphone", "headset", "earbud"
- **Intent Detection**: Understands if you're comparing products, looking for specs, or price shopping

**Best for:**
- Natural language queries: "wireless earbuds for gym"
- Misspelled searches: "smasung galxy" → finds Samsung Galaxy
- Similar product searches: "phone" finds mobile devices, smartphones, etc.

**Example:** Search "wireles hedphones" → Mind Stone corrects to "wireless headphones" and includes earbuds, headsets
